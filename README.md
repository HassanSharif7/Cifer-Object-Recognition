# Cifer-Object-Recognition
In this project, we developed an object detection and recognition system using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes images across 10 classess. We used TensorFlow/Keras to load and preprocess the dataset, and built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) . The model was trained  and evaluated on the test set, achieving a high accuracy.
